# Project Profile

In this lab I had to:
reconstruct deprecated infrastructure, troubleshoot kernel-level networking, and document reproducible workflows. 
Had to turn missing utilities and broken upstream links into useful artifacts.

Key Points:
- Manual reconstruction of `rxe_cfg`
- RDMA interface setup and verification
- Benchmarking with `ib_send_bw`
- Annotated troubleshooting and documentation

This project reflects my commitment to clarity, reproducibility, and operational mastery.
